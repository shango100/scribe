If you are given an argumentative essay topic in an exam where you have no time to research, here are some strategies you can use to write an effective essay:

1) Analyze the prompt: Carefully read and understand the prompt. Identify the key points, main issues, or arguments the topic involves.

2) Determine your stance: Based on your prior knowledge and understanding of the topic, decide on your position. Are you in favor of it or against it? Think about the reasons and evidence that support your position.

3) Brainstorm ideas: Take a few minutes to brainstorm and jot down any relevant ideas, arguments, or examples that come to mind. Draw on your existing knowledge, personal experiences, and observations related to the topic.

4) Develop a thesis statement: Based on your chosen stance and the ideas you generated, craft a clear and concise thesis statement that reflects your position. Your thesis should provide a roadmap for your essay and guide your arguments.

5) Create an outline: Quickly sketch an outline to structure your essay. Include an introduction, body paragraphs (each presenting a separate argument or supporting point), and a conclusion. This outline will help you organize your thoughts and ensure a logical flow.

6) Introduction:

Start with a strong and attention-grabbing opening sentence to engage the reader.
Provide a brief background or context for the topic.
Clearly state your thesis statement, expressing your position on the topic.
7) Body paragraphs:
Dedicate each body paragraph to a separate argument or supporting point.
Present your argument or point, providing a concise explanation or reasoning.
Use examples, anecdotes, or any relevant information you can recall to support your arguments.
Be concise and focus on the quality of your arguments rather than providing extensive evidence or in-depth analysis.
8) Conclusion:
Summarize your main arguments briefly.
Restate your thesis statement and emphasize the significance of your position.
Conclude with a final thought or call to action.
9)  Revise and edit: If time permits, review your essay for clarity, coherence, and grammar. Ensure that your arguments are presented logically and concisely. Check for any spelling or punctuation errors.

10) Proofread: Quickly scan your essay for any obvious mistakes or typos. Correct them if possible.

Remember, in an exam situation with limited time for research, focus on presenting clear arguments based on your existing knowledge and reasoning. While evidence and examples might be limited, prioritize coherence, logical reasoning, and effective communication of your ideas.

Have you ever noticed that some people naturally have a strong presence and others seem to just be invisible wherever they are? Have you ever thought to yourself this is probably due to difference in physical statute and then see some one with an average or even not imposing physique exert such a pervasive and strong presence? If you have observed this and have actually tried to understand the principle behind this then you are like me.

Being present and having your presence felt seems to be an art mastered by a few. Kings and generals have always had a strong and pervasive presence, spies have a not so pervasive presence , even hunters seem to have learnt to exert a presence that blends in perfectly with that of other members of the wild such that they are not seen.

Few months ago i watched a Haitian  movie "Besouro", where the main character learnt to kinda mask his presence in the plantations when he had gunned men chasing him. Today while taking a  sun bath the principle became clear to me. 

**Pervade the room mentally!**  

All is mind, as above so below. The primordial nature of the universe is mental therefore all you need to do is to mentally pervade the space in which u want to exert a presence.
